# Amazon Lex Chatbot Wrapper for Teachers and Students

This website is an Amazone Lex Wrapper where teachers can make an account or log in and easily train and deploy their own Amazone Lex chatbots with a custom input interface. Students can then access those chatbots using a special code (without an account!) to ask it any questions they may have. This website was made with React for the front end and Flask for the back end. It utilizes an encrypted account system and uses AWS via the Boto3 python API to connect teachers and students to the Amazon Lex Chatbot Service.
